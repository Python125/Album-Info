# JavaScript-Album-Webpage

This was another practical exercise to further hone my web development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While keeping the core functionalities simple, I aimed to experiment with adding interactivity and a unique user experience.

The project focuses on the iconic Beach Boys album "Pet Sounds." It showcases each song with a summary and integrates short audio snippets directly into the HTML.  To enhance user engagement, I implemented a text entry animation that slides in from both the left and right sides of the screen as the user scrolls down the page.

In essence, this project served to explore different techniques for incorporating audio elements and user interaction within a webpage.
